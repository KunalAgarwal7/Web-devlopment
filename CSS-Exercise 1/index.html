        <p class="p1">CSS selectors allow us to choose specific elements and apply styles to them. Suppose we want to
            add a custom style to only a specific tag(s). There, we can make use of CSS selectors.</p>

        <p class="p2">CSS Specificity helps determine what style will be applied to the HTML element(s) when there are
            overlapping or multiple CSS rules.
            It is a value or weight assigned to a CSS selector. The higher the specificity, the more precedence the
            selector has.</p>

        <p class="p3">The CSS Box model defines how elements are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated. It
            describes the structure of an element as a rectangular box that has content, padding, a border, and a
            margin.</p>

        <p class="p4">Lists are a common element in web design used to prevent content from being un-organized. CSS
            allows you to style lists to match the design aesthetic and improve the readability of the web page.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="p5">The color property of CSS helps to set the color of the HTML element(s). This helps to set the
            foreground color of text, text decorations, and borders.</p>
